# HyperSpace

A finite SVG grid with pan and zoom functionality.

# How to Use

1. With `hyperspace.js` in the same directory, import and call `hyperspace` and pass in an `svg` element.
2. The `svg` element will then be a grid approximatly three times the size of the svg viewport that can pan and zoom with mouse.
